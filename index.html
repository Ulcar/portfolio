                            <p>I'm an ICT Graduate with a big passion for game development, 3d programming, and low level hardware programming and electronics.  
                            I have been programming in C# and C++ for 4 years now, and have spent the last three years getting heavily game development, mainly using Unity. 
                            My goal in game development is making new kinds of experiences, that aren't just limited to traditional style games, I want to push the medium in ways not seen before!
                            In my free time I mostly go out with friends, go (Kite)surfing, do reading, or play games.
                            Currently spending a lot of free time learning Japanese.

                                        For my graduation internship I worked on my own CAD Asset content Pipeline. This software is a cloud system that I designed myself, using multiple microservices and custom code, to convert CAD files to a Unity readable format.
                                    Big challenges here were integrating the CAD libraries, which were written in C++, into back-end systems on Azure Devops, as well as designing the communication between all microservices. In this project I've also created a Unity application that interfaces with and receives
                                the 3D content, and allows for further editing of said CAD content. The graduation document is public, and can be accessed by clicking on the image.   </p>

                                    <p class="mb-2"> 
                                        Club NOIZ is an online virtual reality venue for raves and other music events, developed in Unity, and my current passion project.
                                        Inspired by clubs in Berlin, our goal with this project was to make a VR "Techno bunker" experience, resembling old berlin buildings repurposed into clubs.
                                        We took visual inspiration from clubs like Tresor and Berghain.
                                        We developed this using Unity and host it in the game vrchat, which allows to host your own Unity projects online, complete with custom scripting and most unity features you would need (with a few limitations for security).
                                        This means the game VRChat can handle things like custom avatars for players and connecting players together, and we mainly have to program custom networking for all our self made components,
                                        such as the VJ screens, the audio synced lighting, or live updating posters showing which DJ is playing, as well as the entire audio and video system.

                                        I mainly work together with two technical artists and one sound designer to bring the environment to life. 
                                        The venue is only accessible once a month when we host an event there, which we usually plan out and announce a few weeks in advance. 
                                        We usually get a few hundred unique logins each opening.

                                        The biggest challenge in developing this project was optimising the environment for both Oculus Quest and PC (The main club room is around 50 draw calls on the mobile version!)
                                        developing shaders for dynamic lighting that doesn't tank the framerate even when 100 people are running around, and within all those constraints still make an environment
                                        that looks and feels like an old run-down techno bunker.

                                        The main challenges for this project were to use the C++ windows API to get transparent windows to work not supported by Unity, and to get the server working for this program. (The server I use is a generic websocket server I programmed that I made for multiple projects)

                                        This project contains two components: A discord bot that reads all messages, And a unity client that receives the messages from the discord bot. The Unity app is a transparent window (Using the win32 API) that overlays every message the bot receives on the screen.
                                        The program also supports Text, Uploaded images, image links, video uploads, and audio uploads and links. The github link shows the client (with old experimental features like webRTC controls still built in), the server is not currently public.    </p>

                                        I've also learned how to work in WebGL during this project, and have made javascript code that communicates with the WebGL client in the browser.

                                    <p class="mb-2"> My first game ever made. It's a top down bullet hell shooter roguelike. (I'm sure you've never heard this concept before).
                                        The biggest design challenge here is creating a unique mechanic not present in other of the same genre, so the main gimmick I designed for this game is that the player can also shoot bullet hell, and can use it to block the enemy's bullet hell.
                                        This was a duo project, where my responsibilities were programming and designing the player mechanics (Moving, shooting, bullet hell), creating bullet hell patterns using math, Designing and programming enemy AI behaviour, and creating the level design of individual rooms.

                                <p class="summary">I've done multiple succesful reverse engineering attempts on Unity games, where I get the full game working within the Unity Editor.
                                    I've done this mostly for Mono compiled games (which are honestly really easy to reverse engineer), but have made IL2cpp attempts with various levels of success.
                                    Pictured above is the game "The Silver case", fully working in my Unity editor, allowing me to make mods for the game easily. 
                                    I of course can't share this source code here directly, but can share my workflow for this if requested!

                                <p>Worked as a Unity developer on this project for half a year. Took part in their entire SCRUM process, and worked on main development responsibilities in their sprints. 
                                Learned a lot about shaders and working on game projects as a team during this internship.

                                <p>Worked on a FBT solution for VR inside Unity, making use of a low latency UDP server written in C++, and a C# UDP client written inside Unity to receive FBT data.
                                    Mainly had to redo this internship due to lack of documentation and polish, which was caused by the pandemic starting in the middle of the project.
